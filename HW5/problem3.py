"""
## Problem 3
Suppose that you want to order some food with a delivery. Use Facade Design Pattern and classes of your choice to
simulate a scenario of ordering using an application, you can have a dispatcher, a restaurant, a delivery guy and other
actors of your choice. The most important thing is that you should have some method which will organize the priority of
the steps that need to be taken when you order the delivery and will "ask" the right parties to do their job. This
should happen without intervention of the client.

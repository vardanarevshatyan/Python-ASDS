## Problem 1
Suppose that you have some images that need to be loaded from some server and be shown to
the user. Since the loading may take some time, we want to have proxy images in case the real
images are not loaded after some fixed amount of time. Simulate this scenario with classes of
your choice and using proxy design pattern principle
